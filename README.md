## What is this?

**100 Days Of Kotlin** is inspired in [#100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4) initiative and [60 Days Of Go](https://github.com/cassiobotaro/60-days-of-go) repository, where I learn something new about Kotlin every day during 100 days.

This project is a piece of a series called **X Days Of Something**, which one includes:
-   [100 Days Of Python](https://github.com/marcosvbras/100-days-of-python)
-   [100 Days Of Ruby](https://github.com/marcosvbras/100-days-of-ruby)
-   [60 Days Of Shell Script](https://github.com/marcosvbras/60-days-of-shell-script)
-   [100 Days Of Swift](https://github.com/marcosvbras/100-days-of-swift)

## Why am I doing this? Why Kotlin?

Writing code that works is easy (most of the time). But writing efficient, clear, concise, scalable, and maintainable code is very difficult. It may be better with a lot of practice in various types of problems and paradigms, in addition to having mastery of the language you are coding.

**Kotlin** is a new promise to Android Development. Since your release, everybody is talking a lot about it. Looking up about this one, I saw that Kotlin is bringing many benefits over Java and it can become the app development more easier and faster. So, why not?
