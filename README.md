## What is this?

**100 Days Of Kotlin** is inspired in [#100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4) initiative and [60 Days Of Go](https://github.com/cassiobotaro/60-days-of-go) repository, where I learn something new about Kotlin every day during 100 days.

This project is a piece of a series called **X Days Of Something**, which one includes:
-   [100 Days Of Python](https://github.com/marcosvbras/100-days-of-python)
-   [100 Days Of Ruby](https://github.com/marcosvbras/100-days-of-ruby)
-   [60 Days Of Shell Script](https://github.com/marcosvbras/60-days-of-shell-script)
-   [100 Days Of Swift](https://github.com/marcosvbras/100-days-of-swift)

## Why am I doing this?

Well, writing code that works is easy (most of the time). But writing **efficient**, **clear**, **concise**, **scalable**, and **maintainable** code is very difficult. It may be better with a lot of practice in various types of problems and paradigms, in addition to having mastery of the language you are coding. Because of that, I decided to code every day to get out of my comfort zone and improve my view about the huge world of software development.

## Why Kotlin?

**Kotlin** is a new promise for Android Development. Since your release, everybody is talking a lot about it. Looking up about this one, I saw that Kotlin is bringing too many benefits over Java and it can become the app development more easier and faster. As an Android Developer, I can't lose this!

So, **let's code**?

## Usage

These examples were compiled with **Kotlin 1.2.41** and [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). It is recommended to install this exactly Kotlin version for a correct running.
